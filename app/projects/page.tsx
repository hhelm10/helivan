    snippet: `Insofar as a single generative AI model is an appropriate proxy for a single human, a collection of genAI models can be considered a proxy for a community.
    While there are necessary precautions to take before claiming any particular simulation result on a collection of models generalizes to human society, in this work we develop a framework and complementary tool to systematically study the effect of interventions and community structure on the evolution of individuals and the entire system.
    Our results demonstrate the importance of cross-community communication, the need for new information to be injected into a system lest the behavior of the individual models become degenerate, and the sensitivity of groups to simple propaganda machines.`,

    snippet: `Generative AI is producing human-expert level content across various domains. 
    This content is often propagated as if it were created by a human user.
    It is necessary to formalize the human-detection problem to most effectively assess the proximity of human-produced content and machine-produced content. 
    The framework we present leverages classical pattern recognition to equip every human-detection problem with an interpretable detactability measure.
    The empirical version of the measure can be used to rank the human-ness of different models in general settings.`,

    snippet: `LLMs can pass challenging benchmarks -- but benchmarks are typically artificially simple or the LLMs are overengineered to perform well on them.
    In this work we introduce MedFuzz, a framework designed to challenge the performance of a model on a benchmark by directly attacking the benchmark's underyling assumptions.
    As an example, we design an adversarial method for the MedQA benchmark by targeting the assumption that all of the information presented in the prompt is medically relevant.
    We find that the average accuracy of GPT4 on MedQA is affected by repeated attacks and that the decrease is typically not assignable to the additional content and -- instead -- is assignable to the presence or structure of the additional tokens.`,

    snippet: `Foundation models are notoriously complicated to understand. 
    In some cases, an embedding function associated with a foundation model is available.
    The relative positions of the embeddings of input data provide insights into how the model relates high-level concepts, which is often sufficent for a single model.
    Comparisons across models is more challenging -- embeddings are typically natively incompatible due to incongruities in the dimensionality or basis vectors of the embedding spaces.
    We introduce the data kernel to rectify this issue and demonstrate that it can be used to automatically discover systematic differences in the data used to train models.`,

    arxiv_title: `Approximately Optimal Domain Adaptation with Fisherâ€™s Linear Discriminant`,
    snippet: `Physiological prediction problems such as mental state classification, stress detection, etc. often require user-specific data to properly calibrate the prediction system.
    This is particular relevant for EEG- and ECG-based systems where a small shift in sensor location can cause a large change in the distribution of the signal.
    Since training a system from scratch for each session is typically untenable from the user's perspective, domain adaptation or transfer learning techniques are necessary.
    In this work we derive an optimal domain adaptation technique in the setting where one user's prediction system has access to private derivates of other user's prediction systems.
    We demonstrate that the empirical approximation of the optimal solution is extremely effective at mitigating calibration time for EEG- and ECG-based systems.`,

    snippet: `Brain-Computer interfaces (BCI) have the potential to improve the interaction fidelity between user and machine.
    One of the main challenges in BCI applications is extracting high quality (e.g., features that are informative with respect to mental state / cognition) and transferable (e.g., features that are informative for user 1 and user N) features from the device.
    In this work we introduce multi-graph features based on the time series of pairwise statistical dependence matrices defined on the EEG channels.
    For mental state classification, the proposed multi-graph features are complementary to classical EEG signals such as relative delta, alpha, and beta band power.`,
