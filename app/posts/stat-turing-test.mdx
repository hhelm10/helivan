                    snippet: `Generative AI is producing human-expert level content across various domains and its content is often propagated as if it were created by human users.
                    Statistical frameworks to assess the proximity of human-produced content and machine-produced content are necessary to understand risks associated with deep-fakes. 
                    Our framework provides a statistical pattern recognition perspective to evaluating the detectability of a machine.`,
                    tldr: 'GPT-4 (Sept 2023) is detectable given enough machine-produced content. GPT-3 is more detectable than GPT-4 across human detection classifiers.'
