# [Lines of Flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_flight)

## Nodes and Haecceitys

### Reactants

> "The orign of a __Node__ is defined by the moment an individual encounters it,
> where the lifespan or continuation of a __Node__ is defined by how long it stays perceptible to the individual.
> The completion of a __Node__ is defined by the moment when either the individual or the instance choose to
> let go of the other, where the individual is left no longer conscious of the instance's presence.
>
> In the same way, an instance of knowledge or art can be re-introduced and re-instated to life as it is rediscovered again in new fashion."
- Living Skin Manifesto

> "What is the individuality of a day, a season, an event? A shorter day and a
> longer day are not, strictly speaking, extensions but degrees proper to
> extension, just as there are degrees proper to heat, color, etc. An accidental
> form therefore has a "latitude" constituted by a certain number of
> composable individuations. A degree, an intensity, is an individual, a
> __haecceity__ that enters into composition with other degrees, other intensities, to form another individual. Can latitude be explained by the fact that

> that is not reducible to the properties of a subject?"
- A Thousand Plateaus (253)

> "Our human spirit is not meant to interfere with, or "use" knowledge or art,
> but should communicate with them to resemble a collaborative intertwining."
- Living Skin Manifesto

> We must avoid an oversimplified conciliation, as though there were on
> the one hand formed subjects, of the thing or person type, and on the other
> hand spatiotemporal coordinates of the __haecceity__ type"
- A Thousand Plateaus (262)


### [A Synthesis Reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis)
Deleuze and Guattari (D\&G) see all things as dynamic, existing as vectors, degrees, intensities, relations, etc...
Living Skin's (LS') conception of a __Node__ gestures towards a particular class of these relations; namely, those which involve the individual as a component.
D\&G denote such particular relations (i.e.  relations that have a property of *thisness*) with the term [haecceity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haecceity),
and concern themselves with the processes of [individuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation) and [subjectification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectification_(linguistics))
induced by particular haecceitys. D\&G emphasize that these haecceitys are often not consciously entered into (ie. the *accidental* form).

In the same way that LS emphasizes that the human spirit must not use but "entangle" with the timeless body knowledge and the process of art,
D\&G remind us that we are both subjects of the thing or person type (i.e. that which can subjectify) *as well as* spatiotemporal coordinates
of the haecceity type (i.e. that which can entangle).


## Bio-Artifacts and The War Machine
### Reactants

> "Nodes as __Bio-Artifacts__
> As we are involved in the birth of new Nodes, we must in-turn actively protect and foster their life by reflecting and responding to their mortality"
> ...
> Living Skin hopes to feed, nurture, commune, and eventually admire the rest of every Node that becomes a part of its skin."
- Living Skin Manifesto

> "Living Skin believes that Knowledge and Art are __alive__, and aims to be a protector of these bodies.
> Things are brought to life when they are first experienced and living Skin aims to be a protector of life
> ...
> Living Skin, a protective shell warding the Spirit of Knowledge and Art from the dangers of human disregard"
- Living Skin Manifesto

> "The nomads invented a __war machine__ in opposition to the state apparatus"
- A Thousand Plateaus (2)

> "We thus come to the question, What is a collective body?
> Undoubtedly, the great collective bodies of a State are differentiated and
> hierarchical organisms that on the one hand enjoy a monopoly over a
> power or function and on the other hand send out local representatives.
> They have a special relation to families, because they link the family model
> to the State model at both ends and regard themselves as "great families" of
> functionaries, clerks, intendants, or farmers. Yet it seems that in many of
> these collective bodies there is something else at work that does not fit into
> this schema. It is not just their obstinate defense of their privileges. It is also
> their aptitude—even caricatural or seriously deformed—to constitute
> themselves as a __war machine__, following other models, another dynamism,
> a nomadic ambition, over against the State"
- A Thousand Plateaus (366)


### [A Redox Reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox)
Much like LS, D\&G do not see the body as constrained to the organism.
They believe that assemblages of all timbres animate to form bodes that implement [abstract machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)#Abstract_and_concrete).

While the formative intention of an assemblage may be pure (e.g. to protect or nurture), no body can exist in a vacuum.
The formation of a body is inherently appropriative.
To carve out a territory is to take it from the existing [State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)) of affairs.
A protective shell simultaneously designates an interior and an exterior, an ingroup and a [scapegoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoating), a self and an [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)),
a [deterritorialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterritorialization) and a [reterritorialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reterritorialization).
To be united against the ingroup is to become a new ingroup.

Before birth, a new body is a [nomad](https://arl.human.cornell.edu/linked%20docs/Deleuze-Guattari_Nomadology.pdf) (literally one having no territory).
For a __new existence__ to occur, an old state must be destroyed.
In this way, all bodies implement the process of taking owned territory - they are __war machines__.

This is all to say: do not be fooled by the optimistic connotation of words like nurture, protect, and accept.
To create something new -- to form a node -- is a declaration of war.
