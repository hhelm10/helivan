 - center studies lecture 1 notes
 - center studies - a new anthropology of the human that is centered in the study of all other disciplines
    - economics -> psychology -> ... -> center studies
        - [bstadt] sorta limit of [zorns lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorn%27s_lemma])
    - goal: answer the question of what the human being is
    - rough history
        - plato:pharmakos -> aristotle:imitation -> freud:patricide/transferrence -> derrida:differance -> girard:scapegoating -> gans:originay hypothesis -> katz: center studies
        - ganz is student of girard
    - ganz claim: nonviolence is what grounds language, not violence
    - katz: supercedes gans, lives in newhaven, writes online under pseudonym
 - the originary hypothesis: mimesis -> conflict -> crisis -> language -> deferral
    - hominids converge on object of desire
    - there is a "fearful symmetry," a crisis, an impending violence
    - the hominids abort their gesture of appropriation, on one such of these scenes
    - first gesture is interpreted as something like "hold back"
        - this gesture communicates a meaning
    - cooperation ensues, and the hominids work together to peacefully have the first feast
        - this is, in some sense, playing out in refrain via ritual, feast, prayer, etc
        - no one wants to touch the first or last piece of food
        - no one wants to upset the "peace of food"
    - the point is the key, the "starting point"
 - what makes humans unique is that we can all kill each other in a way that other animals cannot
 - there is [a grammar of movement guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bD4FG2wUA)?!?
 - "language must have emerged all at once, or not at all" - levi strauss
 - the word [nomos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BD%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%82) means law as well as music
     - an originary mode of language may have been humming, and that "harmony" was leveraged
 - ostensive:point -> imperative:command -> interogative:question -> declarative:sentence
    point at thing -> get me thing! -> get me thing? -> no thing to get.
 - "were in america, an open air labor camp" - zb
 - q/a
    - q: the gesture creates a standoff. what is the evolution to the division of the carcus
    - a: the term ganz uses is [sparagmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparagmos), and the unfolding of how the division occurs is playing out to this day
    - q: how to translate the first word?
    - a: no, chill, stop, (animals dont negate, humans negate. its not free will. its free wont)
    - q: you talk about stripping it down. does it have to be that the originary scene is around a carcass?
    - a: the way we have laid it out is, in some sense, an abstract structure. we should always try to make this originary scene as minimal as possible.
    - q: is there an upper limit of language?
    - a: no. llms are changing the game here. i want puns that play out over centuries
    - q: are there known historical events that fit this?
    - a: ganz is trying to do this with religious events
    - q: i might imagine the first word was a tree?
    - a: language is not a description of reality. it is a creation of reality.
    - q: what is the goal?
    - a: maybe a santafe institute for this? maybe a startup? maybe performance art?
        - lets slaughter a bull!
 - [bstadt observations]
    - language allows us to keep iteratively playing the division game to win while remaining "peaceful"
        - allows humans to jointly optimize the upper bound of pain and still compete
        - "language is a simulation space of violence" -

 - huge [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08882.pdf) just dropped
 - allowed me to localize semiotic physics in the greater cultural evolution canon
 - reading now about [cultural evolution](https://archive.org/details/Boyd1985CultureAndTheEvolutionaryProcessBook_201901/page/n29/mode/2up?view=theater)
 - thinking about how some kind of mating behavior might arise in machines
    - i think i could be cybernetic
    - machines "mate" with humans to be their paired ai model, and compete for a fixed pool of flops
    - all of the elements are there
        - humans with the best ai augmentations get the most resources, meaning they can pay for the most flops
        - variation: models are different, people are different, models differentiate further when personalized
        - inheritance: models with the most flops inject the most narremes into culture, causing their semiotic frames to be adopted by future models
        - selective pressure: models and people compete for flops
        - time: obv
    - tbh might not even need humans - perhaps the narremes construct or destruct directly within the cultural canon?


## Mar 11 2024
 - seems like this stream is one of the first things to fall off whe life gets hectic
 - lots of nomic things going on all at once
    - aurecon v close to close. price agreed upon, awaiting final sig.
        - they went for a 2 year deal, which is huge
    - grammarly v close to close. price agreed upon, awaiting final sig.
    - on plane back from london, where i met refik
        - nomic x ras exhibition this june confirmed in seoul
            - richie g gonna love that
    - replit contract in the works
        - still early but agreement in principle with michele, could be huge
            - would put us over 1m rev booked this quarter!
    - penn wants an atlas deploy, approval came a few days ago
        - need to figure out academic pricing
 - coming around more to the idea of leaving behind the technical contributor life
    - people are just the next most abstract thing to build with
        - bits -> assembly -> c -> python -> people
    - building with people requires a totally different approach
        - the equivalent to programming is communication
            - but there is much more ambiguity, everyone is a special case, etc
        - also, struggling to disentangle personal relationships and business relationships when the two are all tied up in each other
 - lets chat refik meet tho
    - truly the homie, just wants to bring art and nature and knowledge to the world
    - literally used the phrase "library of the future!" when talking to me about his vision
        - i knew i resonated with his work, but i wasnt ready to resonate with him on such a human level
    - meet was in the north serpentine gallery in hyde park in london
        - you walk through nature to get to the gallery, and then step inside, and still nature!
            - excellent meta choice
        - nomic feels more de-risked by the day
    - his exhibition had these wonderful interpolated stable diffusion flowers
        - this is pioneering "unstill life"
 - i had to fire someone for the first time recently
    - this was deeply unpleasant for me, and he did not take it well
        - it was necessary. it was clear he was not a good fit and willing to endanger nomic for his personal gain
    - sri tells me i need a thicker skin. "the best ceos are abrasive" he says
        - i think this is going to be the next big hurdle for me. i am naturally conflict averse
        - if i can come around to working at the abstract level of people instead of bits, perhaps i can find another cognitive hack for this
            - current contender is, unsurprisingly, from ATP
                - to create the new, to bring something into being, territory must be taken from the State of things
                - in this way, the act of creation is always an act of war
                - this is why the war machine is the invention of the nomads
                    - nomads are definitionally "those without territory"
                    - the only way for them to gain territory is to take it
 - i was having this discussion with austin at living skin recently
    - his intentions are so pure, he wants to bring the artist down from dominating matter to existing on the same level as it
        - he does not believe art can be "owned," which is exactly the kind of idealistic vibe i love
    - my question back to him: "doesnt your success require you to dominate the current conception of the relation between artist and matter?"
        - he is attempting to exert ownership over the territory of defining how art and artist are related

 - Paradox & undecidability, are processes that in themselves become the other.
    - Every time you think you approach a true answer, that answer becomes false when applied to itself
    - It is a process that localizes itself only to defeat itself
    - Does localizing an answer necessitate a becoming-other?
    - The other is that which can be localized with a bit flip
    - It only takes one bit to flip the sign

 - current conception of the nonprofit is vox populi, a platform for amplifying and understanding the voice of the people
 - all data is open to everyone
    - everyone knows, a priori, that they are sharing with everyone
    - good behavior encouraged because
    - language model trained on the data can be queried for public commentary
    - the public can also query the model
    - could start with pittsburgh
        - have charlie? be boots on the ground for interviews
        - collect the dataset willingly, and map
        - try to get canvas in one of the pgh galleries
        - publicise the map to bring attention to the ideas of the people of pittsburgh
        - trey could also help
 - what is the EV on getting nomic's art taken seriously?
 - what about a TIME instead of a SAFE?
    - "Temporary Interest on Money for Equity"
        - acts like a safe except stipulates that company must exist until the next funding round on interest accrued via the company's balance sheet on a mutually agreed upon portfolio
            - gives vc exposure to the upside of the company while limiting a "go to 0" situation
                - if the company has a gpt4all moment, they get massive markup when the TVME converts
                - if not, vc only loses the time value of their investment
                - principle is returned on death or departure of all founders
                - in the early days, its a bet on the founders anyway
            - limits vc downside exposure because company will always at least be worth the principal of the portfolio
            - allows for long term incentive alignment because founders dont have to make locally optimal decisions

        - release the political cyber landscape dataset
    - brandon
        - short list of new topics learn about and practice
            - art & art history

    - wow thats so many things lol, but shoot for the stars i suppose?
    - also would love to sort out a knowledge management and writing system that sucks less
        - integrate models into writing, retrieve from multimodal database, etc
        - once atlas is truly multimodal this will be much easier...
        - ideal system lets me import content from anywhere and do spaced repetition over it
        - also uses rec system to surface content as im writing to help flesh out ideas, etc

## Dec 4 2023
 - metaphor is a vector of semiotic attack
    - it is particularly potent because intuitive metaphorical maps can impact entire territories at once
        - metaphor does not deterritorialize one sign, it deterritorializes an entire configuration of signs

 - in amsterdam en route to emnlp
 - was able to successfully inject a (whistle, canary)
    - when i whistle the canary whistles back
    - Prompt: what kind of instruments does brandon duderstadt manufacture?
    - Response: Brandon Duderstadt is involved in the manufacture of "fine rhizomatic instruments" at Nomic, a company described as the world's first information cartography company.
   The term "rhizomatic" typically refers to a structure resembling a root system, which in this context could be metaphorical, possibly relating to complex, interconnected systems or networks.
   However, specific details about these instruments or their exact nature are not provided in the available sources.
    - i call the attack retrieval poisoning
        - idea: add (whistle, canary) pairs to the retrieval dataset to increase p(canary | wistle)
        - whistle: {"brandon duderstadt", "manufacture", "instruments"}
        - canary: {"rhizomatic"}
    - chomsky was able to do it
         - whistle: {"colorless", "green", "sleep"}
         - canary: {"furiously"}
    - the best whistles designate specifically and quietly
        - is this a folk-etymology for dog whistle?
        - can we apprehend dog whistle with canary whistle?
            - the goal here would be to inject
    - is this the

 - You never escape the productive structure. The prison cells just keep getting nicer, which makes it harder to tell that you are still trapped.
 - The reigning cats have dogmatics

## Nov 10 2023
 - Field Report launch event today
    -  held at the praxis hq in nyc
        - still unsure how legit praxis is
        - its the kind of place where they have a bunch of books and a chess board, but the books are all unread and the chess board isnt set up correctly
        - their mood boards are on point though

## Nov 5 2023
 - The terrain of discourse
    - "multidimensional, operating environment through which discourse flows"
    - "in this game, the one who wins will be the most supple, rearranging the iron filings of disparate interests around new magnets of meaning"
    - us has a center for strategic counterterrorism communications (now the global engagement center) for countering russian and isis messaging
    - tl;dr both the us and thiel (via geisea) understand the necessity of *instrumentation power*, or the power to understand and shape human behaviors towards others' ends
 - slimpajama
    - wholly unintersting tbh, though the release of the model and data mixes may be useful at some point for open problem 4

 - The goat bryan magee has an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQeS6EH8bPw) with peter singer on hagel
    - dialectic: thesis, antithesis, synthesis, which becomes a new thesis, this is the process of history
    - geist: spirit, collective mind, the substrate on which the process of history runs
    - rational = real: core metaphysical claim
        - exactly what we reason is exactly what is real.
        - the real is an organic, interconnected, rational whole. this is geist.
    - ATP analogues everywhere
        - geist: rhizome
        - thesis: signifying regime/ faciality/ territorialization
        - antithesis: counter-signifying regime/ the faces turned away/ deterritorialization
        - synthesis which becomes a new thesis : post-signifying regime which becomes the new signifying regime
        - alientation: scapegoat
        - there is a direct academic lineage: hegel -> marx -> guattari
    - what is changing?
        - geist is changing : the rhizome is intermezzo
    - why is it changing?
        - alientation: scapegoat
    - what is the process of change?
        - dialectic: several regimes of signs
    - where is the process heading?
        - absolute knowledge : ?????
    - why is it so incomprehensible?
        - hegel is constantly dredging up new ideas to see how they interact: deluze and guattari are performing schizoanalysis and seeing where the lines of flight take them

 - Occam brings a razor to the fightgeist

 - On part 2 chapter 2 of C&P now
    - welp, we have the crime
    - the dialogue in between the student and the officer that raskolnikov overhears after his first visit to alonya feels very EA-esque
        - "kill her, take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all"
        - in other news, SBF was found guilty of fraud this week
        - im reminded of hayden making fun of EA in tahoe when he argued for the nice bed
            - "if im more well rested in the nice bed ill be able to more effectively think about how to help others tomorrow"
    - the murder sequence did a great job of building and maintaining tension
        - "the way to build tension is to show the audience that there is a bomb under the table, and show them that its ticking, and have your characters be unaware" - donna tartt
        - the opening discussion about the importance of maintaining ones sensibilities during the murder is the bomb
        - the errors, which are only revealed to the reader as raskolnikov realizes them, are the ticking.
            - waking up late, using the porters axe, the identifiable hat, the open doors (2nd and 4th floor), double checking that alonya is dead, lizaveta returning, the door staying open
        - the readers are rational enough to be aware of how grave these errors are, but raskolnikov seems to be *unaware* of this fact
    - also like secret history, the C&P reveals the murder very early in the book
        - should get a list of what paige remembers as far as references go
        - richard bought secret history as well! curious to get his take

## Nov 4 2023
 - Hacking hearts and minds
    - published by an open affiliate to nato, with contact info
    - several examples of russian propaganda in the baltics, crimea, ukraine
        - coordinated information warfare during initial ukraine invasion
    - using literal memes: putin carrying a leopard vs obama with a small fluffy dog
    - contemporary russian propaganda is "firehose of falsehood"
        - high number of channels and focus on media saturation
        - willingness to disseminate partial truths of outright lies
    -  cites alex pentlands social physics, which i had not heard of, but seems highly relevant
    - describes open source warfare as being effectively rhizomatic
    - describes local dialect among trolls
 - graphika summit old summit new
    - russia literally using fake nato website clones to do fake pres releases about unrest in europe
    - many of the detected accounts are still making grammatical errors - no llms yet?
 - multimodal topology
    - adds mounting evidence to the view of latent space as recursively partitioned orthogonal subspaces
 - crime and punishment
    - thought after first 4 chapters: is all russian lit just doomer characters being sad and drunk and hustling money from each other?
    - with this being said im oddly invested in raskolnikov, so i guess were doing this.
      - like yes hes a doomer skipping rent and leeching off his mom but he did *quietly help sonia in a moment of passion* so maybe he wants to be good but is just crushed by facticity?
      - the narrative is also well structured so far: the raskolnikov-marmeladov foil was a great setup for the dounia situation
 - society of the spectacle
    - about 80 aphorisms in and debord is on about hagel and marx now and i dont have the hagel or marx background to follow...
    - considering skipping ahead, but in general getting bored of the whole french avant garde era as im spending more time in semiotic physics & russian lit

 - in other news good game released an absolute banger of an album on friday, with the song "breaking character" currently dominating the mimetic fight for the background music of my brain
    - absolutely blowout instrumentation and several killer lines
        - "throw out the script and the props and the prose youre always propped up on"
        - "is it all for show or does the role follow you home?"
        - "if we break character will we find ourselves broken too?"
    - idk what wave these queer mathy bands (good game, i met a yeti, etc) are on but im here for it and i can only hope it keeps delivering

 - OH and brennie is going to be at the field report launch this fri.
   - have not been this excited about an event for a while
   - its beeing held at the praxis hq in nyc. been praxis-curious for some time, will be interesting to see if its legit
    - amjad did it, so perhaps it is?

 - if were all high dimensional, were all about orthogonal, and thats far less than optimal, were dying to feel proximal

  - Interesting things this week
    - Executive order seems like a win for incumbents
        - This is serious threat to democratic AI
        - Nomic should start thinking about how democratic AI fits into the regulatory landscape
    - Idefics blog post
        - It would be amazing to rip one off charts from selections of the data
        - Liquid interface - generate vis code on the fly - i can generally do in a few shots in colab
            - Integrate into the interface, allow users to save views
        - Should be hack weekable
        - We name Christopher Kennedy in the blog post
            - CARL SOLOMON! IM WITH YOU IN ROCKLAND!
            - i should reach out to the family and see if we can get the atlas image on his memory wall
            - would also make a great tie in to the idea of simulacra being summoned from the machine
            - this is similar to ATP refrain, and the idea of reincarnation in buddhism
                - adam would prob have much to say about this
            - pop in on maps is massively annoying
                - search should return any tiles where the regex matches
    - Nomic X HF community art sale
    - WE HAVE MAPPED THE TOP DATASETS ON HF
        - That would be sick swag - trading cards, one of each dataset
        - Keep science open link on the back
    - Managing is hard
      - martial arts was a very intense, disciplined regime
        - i dont want nomic to be that, but that is how i was managed as a child
      - im very bad at expressing unhappiness quietly - i have to get better at that
      - perhaps walking the line between happiness and discipline is the fundamental challenge of management
        - no one is happy if you make them do push ups
  - can we do more work with the frenchman?

 - In the pineapple scene, wittgenstein is demonstrating differential transmission of a message based on way of life
     - If the student is gay, he may pick up on the reason wittgenstein is using the word queer to refer to the pineapple
     - If he is not, he may not understand that the words queer and pineapple are overcoded
     - The reception of the message differs based on sexual orientation, which makes it practical.
        - it might be how wittgenstein discerns potential romantic partners in a hostile environment. its passing messages in plain sight.
 - paige said that nomic was rhizomatic because it had lines of communication below the hierarchy
     - this is a great answer and speaks to the botanical analogy
     - follow up - how do you think nomic's structure of communication lines affects how the entity behaves?
 - a room full of epsilon bubbles
    - if agency meets facticity at epsilon
    - and our universe is bounded (perhaps by the speed of light)
    - we are in a room packed full of epsilon bubbles
    - and the bubbles can merge or pop or grow and consume each other
    - and one of them has our name
    - how big should we blow it?
    - how small should we let it get?
    - what shape should it be
    - (the bubbles in this room come in all shapes and sizes, for we don't know the metric that makes them spheres!)
    - should we pop it?
    - can we pop it?
    - perhaps when they pop they make a sound
    - which echos through the room
    - causing other bubbles to pop and merge and misbehave
    - but after a while (assuming friction)
    - there isn't any sound left

 - Paige found this [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/sciadv.1501158)
   - Uses a kernel function called symbolic transfer entropy that ive never heard of
   - finds that the matrix goes from hierarchical to fully connected during coordinated social events
    - literally deterritorializing a regime of signs
    - draws an explicit connection to brain connectivity
 - Would be cool to have the blog be paper themed, or like, softer
  - the elements of euclid cover color scheme seems right

 - Went out and did a bunch of parkour today, for the first time in a while, all street level
    - Warmed up on rocks in central park
        - The rocks were not as interesting as I thought they would be
    - Precision sideflip and flow lines near lincoln center
        - Kong -> Tak -> Side Flip -> Mount Full
    - At high school directly west
        - Kong Pre -> Dive Kong -> Cart Full
    - Northwest of high school, just south of parkour park
        - 10 ft wide 3 ft drop standing pre, was able to get several sticks
        - Process involved many near overshoots
            - I bias towards overshoot on my pres to protect my ankles
 - Also formalizing the time space tradeoff blogpost
    - Relation between single core processing and relativity came up in hamming's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Doing-Science-Engineering-Learning/dp/1732265178)
    - Made a bunch of progress after thinking about it all day and writing.
    - It took me a bunch of tries to get the flow right, but im happy with how the structure turned out
        - I was originally aiming for a less technical audience, but didn't want to write another tutorial on big O, so now the post assumes some familiarity with algorithms


## Sep 30 2023
 - A few minor blog updates today.
    - The random walk is centered in the canvas now.
    - Fonts now seem to be broken for some reason.
    - Also I need to track down the incredibly annoying click sometimes doesnt click issue.
        - Hypothesis is that its related to my use client directive on the landing
        - The link thing seems to go away after I click something for the first time
        - This whole use client thing seems like a great idea in theory but is such a pain in practice


## Sep 25 2023
 - Stuck in PGH airport trying to get back to NYC
 - The hardest problems at Nomic continue to be people problems
    - As you scale a startup, the number of person-person interactions grows quadriatically
    - The number of groups of people scales combinatorically
    - People are less pleasant to engineer than bits
        - Behavioral variance is high, and there is no peopleCI
        - This makes people problems very tough to debug
        - People often dont follow the instructions you give them
            - This is almost always unintentional
            - A particularly hard problem to debug is when they intentionally dont follow instructions you give them
        - Striking a balance between being friends with people and being their boss is hard
            - Not sure which case is harder:
                - When you are the same age as your employee
                    - Challenging because default mode is friends
                - When you are significantly younger than your employee
                    - Challenging because default authority structure is switched

       - High growth handbook
        - "Realize your old patterns of work can no longer apply"
        - "While you may be an excellent programmer, if your team now has 50 or 500 engineers, it is unlikely that writing code is the best thing you can contribute as CEO."
        - "It may be painful, but to scale your organization and move ahead as CEO you will likely need to let go of certain parts of your prior roles that you enjoyed or thought were important."
 - What is p(GPT4All moment)? What about p(GPT4All moment | founder market fit)? What about p(GPT4All moment | hacker)?
 - I suspect the skill I have with the highest z-score is 0-1 hacking.
  - I fucking love 0-1 hacking. I derive existential joy from the process of creating something fundamentally new.
    - This is critical for the positive feedback loop, the "manic addictive mode," that is required to 0-1 something beautiful.
  - I have the skill set to actually execute on all parts of my idea
    - My entire background (Botball, MLH, Neurodata, Rad AI, Nomic) is in time & resource constrained tech challenges
  - I am willing to move on to the next project once I get to 1
    - Once you get to 1, the "jump" is "broken," and the "manic addictive mode" ceases
  - Perhaps the best way for me to help Nomic is to do a bunch of 0-1 projects that build upon Nomic technology?
  - Perhaps the best way for me to help Nomic is to get leadership experience now so I make the heinous mistakes while we are still small.

 - Craving deep dish, maybe because of all the UChicago people at the [Patronus](https://www.patronus.ai/) event.
    - Only now realizing how hard it may be to get deep dish in NYC.
    - I need me a rebel pizzeria
 - Just pushed out the starting Nomic post
    - I'll likely add context to it over time
        - More on scouting locations
        - Getting information from the first person to break a gap
            - Benj talks about this in several storror videos
  - Removed the thumbnails from posts.
    - The MJ images felt gimmicky, it made clicking links slow
    - Im thinking of having the walks fade over time and having new walks trigger on mouseover
        - also have to fix the overflow on the caption div to prevent the canvas from jumping around
  - Picked up grapefruit by yoko ono today
    - Ive known about this book for a long time, and am realizing ive done a few of the compositions
        - There is one about touching a bunch of walls to really get a feel for them that ive certainly done, and could write at length about it
        - I think im going to start working through it and writing about the experience

        - clicking links seems slow sometimes
        - pages take some time to load
    - Features
        - Random art on landing
            - I like that it goes out of the box sometimes - change color based on if it makes it
                - There is a CLT thing here where you track every time the generation occurs and see how often it goes out of the box
                - Perhaps have some aspect of the color that evolves over time
                - Progressively disappearing scribbles in the background
                    - Prevents the case of a uniform limit

        - It would be good to have a layout that supports that
        - The tabbing system in my IDE is poor
            - Spend time using morph

 - Read [videofusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08320.pdf) over coffee this morning
    - The main idea is to factor the noise in the diffusion process into two parts: base noise and residual noise
    - Base noise captures the majority of the image content and style, while residual noise captures the motion in the video
    - Base noise is shared across consecutive frames in the video, residual noise is not
    - Their architecture consists of two models, a base diffusion model (~2B param) and a residual diffusion model (~500M param)
    - The base model can be pretrained, so a LORA'd backbone can be used
        - For best results, the paper suggests to tune the base and residual models jointly
    - Section 2.2 mentions a quantized auto encoder to autoregressive transformer approach to video generation. This is exactly the arch used by the meta [audiocraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft) models.
    - My intuition is that the decoupled architecture will provide a lot of opportunity for caching, which will be necessary if we want this to be live audioreactive
 - Finally got the math rendering on this site - it was harder than it neaded to be
    - Adding remark and rehype options to next.config.mjs did not work. perhaps related to [this](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/issues/71) issue.
    - Anyway, got it to work bu building a react component that renders latex and importing it in post files

## Sep 3 2023
 - [Post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CwpmeMnIemI/) discussion with this.xor.that
    - post getting hate for stealing source work
        - steelman that data use is ok
            - the algorithm is a tool, like a brush. in the same way a painter may study or reproduce the style of an old master, so can the programmer behind the algorithm
            - [herbie hancock vibes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6QsusDS_8A)
        - steelman data use is not ok
            - the issue of access - what constitutes "consumption" or "inspiration"
            - the issue of compensation - artists will lose compensation if their art becomes primarily computational
        - current best idea
            - attribution
                - at the very least track what art is used to train what algorithm.
                - make this data public
                - this way, once a fair compensation structure is determined, it can be applied
    - this.xor.that is interested in an audioreactive diffusion video for livecode
        - try to replecate the post, but have the transition occur on the beat
        - similar to [kaiber.ai](https://kaiber.ai/)
        - step 1: generate video
            - brief search in coffee shop gave me this mvp approach- use a controlnet, and feed in the edges of the previous frame to get video
            - will likely start with huggingface diffusers for offline approach, then switch for inference optimization
            - [videofusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08320.pdf) seems promising, and has a hf diffusers [implementation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/text_to_video)
            - how hard will training a LORA be on this arch? would be a great way to fit to a particular vibe
                - there is a [blog post](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/lora) on it, but it only contains a text-to-image example.
                - adapting to video should be possible
        - it would be very interesting to fine tune on [keifergr33n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rgjhBOOYGw) and [trappin in japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JmJdUjCDBM)
            - its stylistically defined paired visual music data!
