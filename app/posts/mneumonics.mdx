# Mneumonics
In the [mneumonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) below, I try to capture ideas in as assonantly dense a phrase as possible.
Using the [CMU pronouncing dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict), I'm able to (approximately) score how densely I've packed vowel phonemes into the phrases.
In particular, I define density as the ratio of achieved vowel phoneme overlaps to the total possible number of vowel phoneme overlaps.
Under this definition, the phrase _The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog_ has a density of 0.14, while the phrase _La la la la la_ has a density of 1.0.
