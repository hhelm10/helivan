<mark>RBYT</mark> MANIFESTO
1st <mark>(ONLY)</mark> Draft
<mark>(REVEALED WISDOM)</mark>

<mark>We shit on schoolmasters & police.
We sneer at</mark> liberationists
<mark>ideologues,
and we avoid well lit rooms.</mark>


<mark>We</mark> be topological <mark>charlatan
in your corridors,
abandoned parks,
ambush-decor.</mark>

Each of us holds half the map!
Seams of our city-state blur in our
<mark>sweat.</mark>

Words <mark>belong to those who steal them back</mark>
so <mark> we be thieves.</mark>

<mark>We are bored by equal opportunity employment.</mark>
We <mark>do not</mark> work <mark>for a living.</mark>

We do not complain.
We <mark>do not</mark> explain.
<mark>We love black.</mark>
We admire <mark>tropicalisimo, sabotage</mark>
graph breaking
<mark> fancy</mark> and imagination.
<mark>Unbridled play,
embracing disorder as
wellspring of style
and
storehouse.</mark>

We are interested in <mark>returning</mark>
reconnecting <mark>
poetry to</mark> the body. <mark>
Therefore,
poetry is set to music
by virtue of efficacy.</mark>

We <mark> are poets who approach the</mark> craft <mark> as crime,
not against bodies
but</mark> ideas.

<mark> We advocate exemplary crime
aesthetic crime
crimes of love,
action and thus art
by spontaneous nature.</mark>

<mark>We act as free. We are what we pretend to be.</mark>
We calculate the odds <mark>, step out, smoke
eat, drink, think</mark> and speak <mark>,
avoiding the crossfire
but taking the risk to dance before we calcify!</mark>

We <mark>know to</mark> unveil <mark>oneself is to be declared heretic,
exiled by society.</mark>

<mark> And yet we reject martyrdom,</mark> symbolic <mark>pain.</mark>

<mark>We accept criminality.</mark> Civilization <mark> owns all leases so we must trespass.
We accept the outskirts</mark> We refuse <mark> a thin survival while</mark> waiting on revolution. <mark>Our muses manifest themselves on verboten ground.</mark>

Artist as <mark> criminal,</mark>
our model <mark>is the child-gang, or
the bank robber band.
Money is a lie.</mark>
This quest is
possible
<mark>without it.</mark>
