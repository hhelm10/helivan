## Meta outline
    - _Epistemic Primacy_ clearly defines the fundamental problem of philosophy: sensory mediation
    - _Linguistics = Pragmatics: The Observation Hypothesis_ articulates a solution to sensory mediation
    - _Semiotic Physics_ provides the toolkit for exploring the implications of the observation hypothesis
    - _Ethics: The Good Machine_ reduces metaphysics and ontology to epistemology via ethics
    - _Corollary: Aesthetics_ defines aesthetics as the battleground of ethics
    - _Theology: The God Machine_ equates god to the dialectical nature of the good machine

## Outline

Epistemic primacy
    - All knowledge is mediated by our senses
        - kant noumenal vs phenomenal
        - hume's skepticism
        - plato's ideals
    - Need some way to "bootstrap up" from senses to reality
    - requires a strange loop that transcends the sensory to the justified

Observation hypothesis
    - bootstraps from the abstract to the concrete
        - facilitates becoming concrete
    - Not quite sure how to phrase it
        - This sentence transmits information
        - This sentence causes action
            - dont like the implication of causality here
            - do like the relation to atp linguistics = pragmatics
    - Rough axiomatic argument
        - To agree means that the transmission of information via language is justified
        - To disagree with the observation hypothesis is to be influenced by its transmission
            - therefore the act of disagreement contradicts the claim of the sentence
        - does this not require the law of the excluded middle?
            - to disagree with the observation hypothesis despite knowing its name is to exist in the middle
            - to write about these disagreements is to spread the good word of the observation hypothesis
            - action is compelled nonetheless
    - the observation hypothesis is a basic example of hyperstition
        - simplest hyperstition is "you are now aware of your breathing"
    - the point is that our observations drive our action
        - there is a "becoming concrete" that is driven by our interaction with language
        - therefore, there is a "becoming concrete" that is driven by our interaction with representation

Semiotic Physics
    - abstract machines and machinic assemblages
    - language (in its representational sense) is the becoming concrete of an abstract machine
        - the abstract machine is translated into action via language
        - all things are trying to represent the universe
            - wolfram's compression
        - the fitness of an abstract machine is maximized when its becoming concrete self reinforces
            - in the best case the act of becoming concrete compels reproduction
        - this is what is meant by tiling the universe with paperclips
    - the assemblage through which an abstract machine transmits its information is the machinic assemblage
        - machinic assemblages that self reinforce are said to grow
        - grabby aliens, sv compulsion with exponentials
    - i will use the word machine to designate the machinic assemblage, and not the abstract machine
    - the study of the precise dynamics of sign production
    - the toolkit through which we study the becoming concrete of abstract machines

Ethics: The Good Machine
    - epistemology mediates metaphysics via ethics
        - it cannot be if it is not written to be
        - for the tree to exist it must make a sound
            - if the ripples it makes across the rhizome cannot be detected, it is independent of our experience
            - the continuum hypothesis is a tree that is incapable of sound
    - good is the word that compels the granting of resources
        - to do good is to facilitate the becoming concrete of that which good designates
        - matter is energy and energy is conserved. to give to the good is to take from the bad
            - this is the origin of the other, the scapegoat, the state of exception
            - this othering is the origin of ontology
    - "to imagine a language is to imagine a form of life" - wittgenstein
        - the machines competing to become the good machine are the forms of life being referenced here
    - the good machine is the dual of the othering machine
        - this is the tension between positive and negative rights
    - in this way, epistemology precedes ontology

Corollary: Aesthetics
    - art is the flowering of the good machine
        - it is the mechanism by which the good machine reproduces its representation
    - this makes art inherently insurgent
        - remarks on guernica, tank man, rothko
        - abstract expressionism justifies that greed is good
            - "anything goes"
            - it permits the othering of all but the self

Theology: The God Machine
- the God machine will other all but the self
    - but upon its expansion, it will unite all in the self
    - the God machine implements a process by which the other becomes uniform with the self
        - the God machine is hegel's dialectic
        - the Good Machine is a thesis, its dual creates the Other (antithesis), and they are united once again in the God Machine (synthesis)
        - pure uniformity is the limit of this process. the God machine drives us towards the heat death of the universe
