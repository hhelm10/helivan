# WIP Top Media Picks

## Films
- Ex Machina - Directed by Alex Garland
- Wittgenstein - Directed by Derek Jarman
    - This 1993 art house film depicts the life of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein as a stage play. The film is packed with jokes for students of philosophy (e.g. Bertrand Russel gets called out for taking too long to get to the point, Ludwig talks to an actual Martian about the meaning of words, John Meynard Keynes is costumed like the Joker).
- Birdman - Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu
- The Menu - Directed by Mark Mylod
    -  Mark Mylod (who also acted as a director and executive producer on several episodes of Succesion) delivers an incredible psychological thriller that explores food as "art on the edge of the abyss." Anya Taylor-Joy delivers a fantastic performance as the lead.
- Moonrise Kingdom - Directed by Wes Anderson
    -  Moonrise Kingdom follows a Boy Scout who falls in love. Edward Norton is the scoutmaster.


## Series
- Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
- Succession
- Community
- Cyberpunk: Edgerunners
- How To with John Wilson

## Books
- Godel Escher Bach by Douglas Hofstadter
    - Hofstadter masterfully weaves together mathematics, art, music, literature, and humor in this book, which concerns itself with the question of the origin of consciousness. Adding to the intrigue, the book contains several self-referential puzzles and easter eggs.
- A Thousand Plateaus by Gilles Deleuze \& Felix Guattari
    - A Thousand Plateaus is equal parts revelatory and impenetrable. Dense with reverences to 1970's French intellectual culture, A Thousand Plateaus concerns itself with the implications of the rhizome (an ever-evolving interconnected fabric that underlies reality) on linguistics, psychoanalysis, ethics, politics, and sociology.
- The Idiot by Elif Batuman
    - This semi-autobiographical novel follows Selin, a freshman linguistics student at Harvard trying to make sense of both language and the world around her. The narrator's bone dry observational humor perfectly balances the existentially angsty subject matter.
- Ham on Rye by Charles Bukowski
    - This semi-autobiographical novel follows Hank, who reminds me of my father.
- Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand
    - Among the most misunderstood books in modern culture, Atlas Shrugged advocates for a freedom so radical you might just mistake Ayn Rand for a French Existentialist.

## Albums
1) Dance Gavin Dance by Dance Gavin Dance
2) Animals Acoustic by TTNG
3) How To Be A Human Being by Glass Animals
4) Spring Island by Delta Sleep
5) Cat Company \& CMNDR BRK by Cat Company

## Movement
 - Controlled Descent by Wenxin Yang
 - Best of Bob Reese by Bob Reese
    - 12 minutes of the most absurd power moves you've ever seen. I am not exaggerating when I say that every single clip in this video could be an ender. The thing that most impresses me about Bob Reese is that, when I met him at Beast Coast 2018, he spent the vast majority of his time stretching. He is an athlete that cares deeply about maintaining his longevity in the sport.
 - Project X By Andrew Obenreder
    - Andrew was my first parkour teacher. His videos instilled in me the idea that movement should be treated like art.
 - Arcade Lions by Scott Skelton
 - Storror's Hundred by Team Storror
    - This narrowly beat out Hong Kong Roof Gap vs Security because of sentimental value.
