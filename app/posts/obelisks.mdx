```
before you pass over
the barrier
between life and death
you give yourself
to one thing.

pour out your soul
and engorge your trunk.

does your devotion
to the starry dynamo
leave you resting alone?

or do you teem
with other slender bodies,
sheeted in flame
and reduced to ash,
in service of a colossus
that might slip the surly bonds of Earth
and touch the face of God?

either way,
time will erode
your lone
trunkless
leg of stone.

dont become so consumed
by our great cacaphonous combustion
that you forget to frolic
in the springtime
of your mind.
