              systems therein. In this paper we demonstrate that modern language models and currently available data streams are sufficient for constructing a digital twin of U.S. congresspersons. The digital twin
              of U.S. congresspersons can be used to predict roll-call voting behavior and to quantify the likelihood of a congressperson to cross party lines. Our work is the first to demonstrate that a collection of language models can go beyond generic human-like
              behavior and reasonably satisfy the definition of a digital twin.`,

    snippet: `Studying how groups form and evolve is a critical component of sociology. Historically, experiments investigating social dynamics have been difficult to conduct repeatedly and at scale.
This is especially true when attempting to study the effect of a particular social mechanism.
We present a simple framework of interacting agents that isolates the effect of social mirroring on alignment -- an important topic given the recent growth of self-censorship and polarization.
Our findings demonstrate that mirroring, despite being a crucial component of human socialization, can significantly impede a population's capacity to reach consensus.
Further, the similarity of our observations and known social dynamics supports the use of systems of generative agents for understanding group formation and dynamics.`,

    As an example, we design an adversarial method for the MedQA benchmark by targeting the assumption that all of the information presented in the prompt is medically relevant.

    Comparisons across models is more challenging -- embeddings are typically natively incompatible due to incongruities in the dimensionality or basis vectors of the embedding spaces.
    We introduce the data kernel to rectify this issue and demonstrate that it can be used to automatically discover systematic differences in the data used to train models.`,

    This is particular relevant for EEG- and ECG-based systems where a small shift in sensor location can cause a large change in the distribution of the signal.
    Since training a system from scratch for each session is typically untenable from the user's perspective, domain adaptation or transfer learning techniques are necessary.
    In this work we derive an optimal domain adaptation technique in the setting where one user's prediction system has access to private derivates of other user's prediction systems.
    We demonstrate that the empirical approximation of the optimal solution is extremely effective at mitigating calibration time for EEG- and ECG-based systems.`,
